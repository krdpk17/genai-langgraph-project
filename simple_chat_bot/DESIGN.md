# Design Document: Gemini LangGraph Chat App

## Overview
The Gemini LangGraph Chat App is an interactive chat application that uses Google's Gemini model to generate responses. It leverages LangGraph for workflow management and provides a simple command-line interface for user interaction.

## Architecture

### Components
1. **State Management:**
   - The `State` class manages the current state of the chat, including messages and account information.

2. **Account Information:**
   - The `get_account_info()` function fetches and returns details about the Gemini account, including available models and current model details.

3. **LangGraph Workflow:**
   - The workflow is defined using `StateGraph`, which includes nodes for processing input and generating responses.
   - The `process_input` node handles the initial message processing.
   - The `generate_response` node uses the Gemini model to generate a response based on the current state.

4. **User Interface:**
   - The command-line interface allows users to input messages and receive responses from Gemini.
   - The app runs in a loop until the user types `exit` or `quit`.

## Workflow
1. **Initialization:**
   - The app fetches Gemini account information and initializes the state.

2. **User Interaction:**
   - Users input messages, which are processed and sent to the Gemini model.
   - The model generates a response, which is displayed to the user.

3. **Termination:**
   - The chat session ends when the user types `exit` or `quit`.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
- Add support for multi-turn conversations to maintain context over multiple interactions.
- Integrate additional features such as message history and user authentication.
